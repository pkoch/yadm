# If you get some error like
# ```
# /home/pkoch/.linuxbrew/bin/heroku: line 45: /home/pkoch/.linuxbrew/opt/heroku-node/share/node: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
# ```
# It's prolly because heroku's pre-bundled node doesn't work for you. Try
# installing a new node, and rejigger things like:
# ```
# $ cd /var/home/pkoch/.linuxbrew/opt/heroku-node/share/
# $ mv node node.old
# $ ln -s `which node`
# ```
